# Boids

I'll be coding daily for 100 days. No particular order, theme or progression, the rule is to never miss a day.

This is my first project: Boids simulation. After watching [Fouloscopie's video on school of fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch7VxxTBe1c), I thought "oh, this looks fun".

You can run this project locally if you want. You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. The rest is classic Node.js stuff.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinotmandresy/boids-ts.git
cd boids-ts
npm install
npm run dev
# or npm run build && npm start
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/boids-ts/`
